When the employees log their hours, they can maxiumum do 200 hours because that's the monthly limit

The project doesn't get pass the login form, I tried many thingS but couldn't figure it out so I thought
it would be best to just code out the rest of the project rather than get stuck for too long which I did.
I still made a lot of the functions required and tests to test them.

Endpoints:
