To start the project
start mongosh from bin folder
node server.js on cd C:\Users\vegar\Desktop\eksamenapi\untitled\src
npm start

When the employees log their hours, they can maxiumum do 200 hours because that's the monthly limit

The project doesn't get pass the log in form, I tried many thing but couldn't figure it out so I thought
it would be best to just code out the rest of the project rather than get stuck for too long which I did.
